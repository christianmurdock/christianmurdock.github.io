        <h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
        <p>I first gained interest in software when I was exposed to web development in high school, which is where I got the idea to pursue my <i>Associate of Applied Science Degree for Software Development</i>. I am currently learning the basics of <i>Web Application Development</i> as well as an <i>Introduction to Programming</i>, and will start learning more advanced topics my second year.
            Since the start of classes <strong>this fall</strong>, I have so far started up an online presence via WordPress and am learning more about the web to enhance the quality of my website.</p>
        
        <h2><strong>Hire Me!</strong></h2>
            <p>I will graduate in the Spring of 2026 and am eager to take an internship! Contact me at Christian Murdock or (208)781-8950.</p>
